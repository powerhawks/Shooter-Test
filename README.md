# Shooter-Test
To test:
1. Verify and configure motor numbers in code and on robot - the shooter controllers have an abbreviated label with number on them
2. Test motors in Test mode on DriverStation. Press buttons X-Y and LB/RB to make sure motors are spinning right way (record in ENB)
3. Test piston system in Test mode using Up/Down DPAD (record changes in ENB)
4. Test raising shooter to 60 degrees and intaking/outtaking
5. Test shooter in PERCENT mode at Scale and Switch (record percentages and motor speeds in ENB) NOTE: Testing in percentage mode MUST be a dual button control setup
6. Set Motor VELOCITY values in SmartDashboard to recorded values
7. Test shooter in VELOCITY mode in either SINGLE or DUAL control setup. 
8. Have fun!
